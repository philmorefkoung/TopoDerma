# TopoDerma
Code for the paper <br />

Our project explores the application of topological deep learning to improve skin cancer classification across 4 diverse datasets. Through shared self-attention, CLS tokens are able to dynamically select and aggregate the best features from the topology and vision transformer inputs. <br />
